A little more than two weeks ago I quit my job at Chartbeat after 4 years. Over the next week I ended my lease, put most of my belongings into storage, packed a couple shirts and some essentials into a 30 liter backpack, and hopped on a one-way flight to Cartegena, Colombia.

For my first couple weeks I bummed around the north coast, slept on a hammock on the beach at Parque Tyrona, raved until 5am at a hostel buried in the jungle, and got lost and soaked by rain while hiking in the cool mountains of Minca.

Now I've found myself in Medellín, Collombia. The city that I visited earlier this spring and convinced me to start this trip. And, two weeks in, I find myself transitioning from a vacation mindset to "this is what my life is now". With that, I've started to think about how I should be spending my time.

Living in New York came with the price of every day seeming too short. I crammed my waking hours with work, friends, dates, books, and classes. Now, my time is my own. If I want to spend a little more time some place, I can. I don't _have to_ do anything, or be anywhere. There's no judge of how I spend my time but myself.

After catching a cold, I decided to take my first couple days in Medellín slow. I spread-sheeted my expendentures, caught up on email, and then stumbled into a list of my old unfinished or unmaintained side-projects. I picked one that seemed easy to clean up, [cowsay.me](http://www.cowsay.me), a service I originally ran as [a single tweet-sized one-liner](https://twitter.com/dproi/status/507177515446960128) and fixed it. Without a dedicated linux server, the domain pointed to nothing for some time, so I ported the concept to a much less elegant [python flask service](https://github.com/x/cowsay.me), deployed it to a free heroku instance, updated the DNS, and called it a day.

Why did I do that? I'm sitting in one of the most lush and beautiful cities in the world, but hacking away at a cow that spews out occasionally offensive nonsense?

Later that night I grabbed drinks with a friend that I had me a week prior in a different city. We talked about self-definition and I expressed my concern that, even far away from the city that burned me out, I find myself wandering back to my old habbits and needing to hack.

She said, _"You're in the beginning of this trip, so maybe I'm like your Ghost of Chistmas Past. Where you're comparing yourself to the person you have been up until now. I think that, later, you'll start comparing your current life to the lives of your friends back home. And then, even later than that, you'll meet a Ghost of Christmas Future and they'll show you that no one's going to come to your funeral if you can't stop thinking about code and chill the fuck out for a minute Devon."_

They were wise words from someone drunk on cheap tequilla.
