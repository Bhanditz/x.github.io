But this year, instead of resolutions to go to the gym, cook at home, or not horde shiny gadgets, I thought I&#39;d make resolutions that would help me improve myself as a developer.</p><h2>1. Put my dot files on a diet</h2><p>I love the &quot;Unix as an IDE&quot; philosophy. I use Vim as my code editor, tmux to manage my sessions, and a myriad of Unix tools to poke and prod my code.</p><p>But, over the years, my desires for the next best plugins, more <em>elegant</em> shortcuts, and everything to have Vim-like keybindings have made my dot files fat slobs. <strong>By the end of this year, my dot files will be smaller, not larger.</strong></p><h2>2. Improve my Linux-foo</h2><p>Since graduating school and working in the real world, my ability to weaponize basic Unix tools has skyrocketed. I find myself regularly crafting long chains of tools that, until recently, I had not known existed.</p><p>However, there are a few tools that, even though I know are useful, avoid using properly due to their steep learning curves. To approach this I&#39;ve come up with three sub-resolutions.</p><ol><li><strong>Use find like a man.</strong> Up until now I&#39;ve only every used find by doing <code>find . | grep filename</code>. I know it can do much more, but it&#39;s unnatural flags have scared me. I will conquer these fears and learn to use find properly.</li><li><strong>Learn Sed &amp; Awk.</strong> My father once told me he writes all his code in either assembly or Awk. Its terrified me ever since. But I know these tools are the next step in my path to pipe-chain enlightenment. I will master these languages to use them prominently in my tool set.</li><li><strong>Write tar commands without referencing the man page.</strong> This has been a goal of mine ever since I was a naive teenage Linux user who attempted to install things from source. <a href="https://xkcd.com/1168/">Even XKCD knows my pain</a></li></ol><h2>3. Get better at setting and reaching goals</h2><p>This is a big one. It&#39;s a problem I find myself facing more and more in my growth as a developer. When I was in school, I had grades to keep me motivated to reach assignment goals. In my free time I went to hackathons which motivated me to reach personal project goals.</p><p>I&#39;ve grown as a developer since then, and so have my goals. The things I do at work are more challenging and open-ended then anything I did in school. The things I desire to build outside of work have vastly outgrown a caffeine-fueled weekend.</p><p>At work, I&#39;ve decided to embrace the tools provided to us. For Chartbeat, this namely means Asana. I will keep everything I do in Asana as a goal, pace myself with deadlines, and most importantly, only do things that I&#39;ve set in those goals. This is to quell my desires to refactor and optimize.</p><p>Outside of work it becomes much harder. I struggle with balancing my desire to learn iOS with my need to clean my apartment. To face this, each week I&#39;m setting a goal and blocking out time to work on that goal. The hardest part will be to keep focus on one project over many weeks. I find that the rate at which I have and become excited about new ideas greatly exceeds my realistic rate of execution.</p><hr><p>I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever actually kept a new year resolution for the entire year. It&#39;s all too easy to fall back into the same old habits. But, at the very least I&#39;m identifying my weaknesses and defining ways to improve them. I&#39;m looking forward to this year.</p></article><div class="back"> <a href="/">Back</a></div></main></body></html>
