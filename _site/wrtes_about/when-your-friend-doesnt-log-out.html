As their friend, you care about them and feel the need to teach them the importance of security. Here are some suggestions for some simple one-liner <em>lessons</em> you could stick in that file.</p><p>If it&#39;s their first time, start with something simple. <code> alias ls=&quot;cd&quot; </code></p><p>Maybe make their favorite tool unfamiliar. <code> alias vim=&quot;emacs&quot;; alias emacs=&quot;vim&quot; </code></p><p>Create a problem that grows when inspected. <code> alias ls=&quot;touch \`fortune\`; ls&quot; </code></p><p>Take away their sense of control. <code> alias cd=&quot;cd \`ls -d */ | shuf -n 1\`&quot; </code></p><p>Play the long game. <code> echo \&quot;sleep 1\&quot; &gt;&gt; ~/.bashrc&quot; </code></p><p>Leave something to surprise them.</p><div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-" data-lang="">sh -c "sleep $RANDOM; cat /dev/random" &amp;
</code></pre></div><p>Fuck them. <code> mv ~/.bash_history ~/.bashrc </code></p><p><em>If you would like to do this on OS X, just keep in mind that by default you won&#39;t have fortune or shuf, and the .bashrc isn&#39;t loaded on new sessions. You&#39;ll have to attack their .bash_profile instead.</em></p></article><div class="back"> <a href="/">Back</a></div></main></body></html>
