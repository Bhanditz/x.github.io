As their friend, you care about them and feel the need to teach them the importance of security. Here are some suggestions for some simple one-liner <em>lessons</em> you could stick in that file.</p><p>If it’s their first time, start with something simple.<br /> <code> alias ls="cd" </code></p><p>Maybe make their favorite tool unfamiliar.<br /> <code> alias vim="emacs"; alias emacs="vim" </code></p><p>Create a problem that grows when inspected.<br /> <code> alias ls="touch \`fortune\`; ls" </code></p><p>Take away their sense of control.<br /> <code> alias cd="cd \`ls -d */ | shuf -n 1\`" </code></p><p>Play the long game.<br /> <code> echo \"sleep 1\" &gt;&gt; ~/.bashrc" </code></p><p>Leave something to surprise them.</p><pre><code>sh -c "sleep $RANDOM; cat /dev/random" &amp;
</code></pre><p>Fuck them.<br /> <code> mv ~/.bash_history ~/.bashrc </code></p><p><em>If you would like to do this on OS X, just keep in mind that by default you won’t have fortune or shuf, and the .bashrc isn’t loaded on new sessions. You’ll have to attack their .bash_profile instead.</em></p></article><div class="back"> <a href="/">Back</a></div></main></body></html>
